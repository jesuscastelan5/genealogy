# Genealogy Maker

## Short Description
This project is meant to help people make electronic genealogies without having to
(a) use the internet and (b) share information they would like to keep private.

## Background
I became fascinated by how MUMPS, a language used in health-tech, was able to handle data not stored in a table but in a tree.
After thinking about it more and more, I got an idea of how to implement a tree data structure.
This project uses one of those implementations — linked nodes.
I learned a lot about making and using pointers in this project, and I even became somewhat of a fan.

## How to use
1. Add your family members one by one
2. Make / dissolve the necessary connections
3. Save to a txt file

## Current Status
These are the functionalities I would like to add to this project at some point:
- Be able to draw the connections between the nodes.
- have option to load from/save to txt as well as csv
